\section*{Statement}

Two independent random variables are given: $\alpha$
(uniformly distributed at $[1, 2]$) and $\beta$ (uniformly
distributed at $[0, 1]$).

1) Find the distribution function and probability density function of $\xi = \alpha + \beta$.

2) Find the distribution function and probability density function of $\eta = \alpha - \beta$.

3) Find the distribution function and probability density function of $\mu = \beta / \alpha$.

4) Find the distribution function and probability density function of $\nu = \alpha * \beta$.

5) Find $E(\xi)$, $E(\eta)$, $E(\mu)$.
