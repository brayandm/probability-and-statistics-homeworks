\subsection*{Statement: 5.3}

Let $1_A$ $1_B$ be indicators of the events $A$, $B \subset \Omega$. Find the erroneous statements:

1. $1_A \cdot 1_B = 1_{A\cap B}$

2. $1_A \cdot 1_A = 1_A$

3. $1_A + 1_B = 1_{A\cup B}$

4. $1_A \cdot (1 - 1_B) = 1_{A\setminus B}$


\subsection*{Solution: 5.3.1}

We have that $1_A \cdot 1_B = 1$ if and only if $1_A = 1$ and $1_B = 1$.
Because if some of them is $0$, then the product is $0$.


We have that $1_{A\cap B} = 1$ if and only if both events $A$ and $B$ occur, this
is the same as $1_A = 1$ and $1_B = 1$.

Then both $1_A \cdot 1_B$ and $1_{A\cap B}$ are equal to $1$ if and only if
$1_A = 1$ and $1_B = 1$, and they are equal to $0$ otherwise.

So the first statement is \textbf{true}.


\subsection*{Solution: 5.3.2}

We have that $1_A \cdot 1_A = 1$ if and only if $1_A = 1$.
Because if $1_A = 0$, then the product is $0$.

We have that $1_A = 1$ if and only if the event $A$ occurs.

So $1_A \cdot 1_A$ and $1_A$ are equal to $1$ if and only if the event $A$ occurs,
and they are equal to $0$ otherwise.

So the second statement is \textbf{true}.


\subsection*{Solution: 5.3.3}

Here if the events $A$ and $B$ occur, then $1_A + 1_B = 2$, and because the indicator function
is always $1$ or $0$ then formula $1_A + 1_B = 1_{A\cup B}$ can not be true.

So the third statement is \textbf{false}.


\subsection*{Solution: 5.3.4}

We have that $1_A \cdot (1 - 1_B) = 1$ if and only if $1_A = 1$ and $1_B = 0$.
Because if $1_A = 0$ or $1_B = 1$, then the product is $0$.

We have that $1_{A\setminus B} = 1$ if and only if the event $A$ occurs
and the event $B$ does not occur (by definition of the set difference).

So $1_A \cdot (1 - 1_B)$ and $1_{A\setminus B}$ are equal to $1$ if and only if
the event $A$ occurs and the event $B$ does not occur, and they are equal to $0$ otherwise.

So the fourth statement is \textbf{true}.
